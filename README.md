# USBanana_UART

Breakout board for the MCP2200 USB to UART bridge from Microchip.
I made this board because the FTDI chip is quite expensive and the MCP2200 can be acquired for a significantly lower price or even as a sample. 
The gerbers and the schematic are in the version folders, the BOM is nearly identical for both.

The board can be ordered in 2 versions at OSH Park:
USBanana UART v1.0: 
This version has a small mistake, the pins GP4-7 are labeled in the wrong order.
Additionally the LEDs are in an 0603 package because I managed to order them as a sample only in 0603.

USBanana UART v1.1: 
The mistake is corrected in this version and the LEDs are in an 0805 package.
